# Towers Of Hanoi
### Game Rules
The game “Towers of Hanoi” is a mathematical, problem solving game. It consists of three equal bases A, B and C on which discs of different sizes are placed.</br>
At the beginning all slices are placed on base A, ordered by size, with the largest at the bottom and the smallest at the top. The goal of the game is to move the entire stack from A to C. </br>
Every turn, the top disc of any base can be placed on top of one of the other two bases, if there is not already a smaller disc there. That means that at each point of the game, the slices on the stacks are ordered by size.
